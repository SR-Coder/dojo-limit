            <h2>Have your reached your limit?</h2>
            <p>A simple chrome extension that add or removes the stacks that you want! Current version requires refreshing the page to see the updates. </p>
            <p>INSTRUCTIONS: To use simply click the grey stack buttons to add a stack to your "Currently Installed Stacks" stacks.  If you want to remove a stack simply click any "Currently Install Stacks" and it will remove it from your list.  Finally refresh you coding dojo main page and see the useless stacks melt away!!  Enjoy!!!</p>
            <p> NOTE: you may need to refresh multiple times as the stacks are loaded via an async process.  And since the page is a single page app you will need to refresh any time you navaigate back to the main stacks page.  Sorry... working on updates to this presently.  </p>
